# Microscope Viewer

This is a simple web application for viewing a microscope that has a flipped image. It corrects the image orientation and provides a fullscreen view.

## Usage

1.  Make sure your microscope is connected to your computer and recognized as a webcam.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  The application will request permission to use your webcam. Allow it to proceed.
4.  The microscope feed will be displayed, flipped to the correct orientation.

## Features

*   **Corrected Image:** The video feed is vertically flipped to compensate for the microscope's optics.
*   **Fullscreen Mode:** A button is available to view the feed in fullscreen.
